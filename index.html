<div class="section" id="important">
<h1>Important!</h1>
<p>Make sure to do this homework, as it will be the focus of the morning lecture
tomorrow. Draw your data models -- this is super super useful scaffolding for
your project.</p>

<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In the Movie, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Crystal">&quot;The Dark
Crystal&quot;</a>, the evil
Skeksis are able to restore their youth by draining and consuming the
essense from other beings. They've driven the Gelfling race to the brink
of extinction (only two remain), however there are still plenty of
Podlings that can be rounded up.</p>
<p>The Skeksis consume the essence of a lot of Podlings. They're also a
greedy race, so there are constant fights over who has consumed the most
essence. The chief prison warden of the Skeksis has requested you build
him a database to help her keep track of everything.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="requirements">
<h1>Requirements</h1>
<p>Here's what you know:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The prison currently has 20 cages to hold their captives, though they
may want to add more if they get a large haul.</li>
<li>Each cage can hold up to 5 prisoners of either type (Podling
or Gelfling). It's fine to mix prisoner types in a cage.</li>
<li>Each Podling has a certain amount of essence stored within them. When
processed and entered into the system, the Skeksis will measure the
essence and record it as an integer between 0-500.</li>
<li>Gelflings hold a large amount of essence (between 0-10000 units).</li>
</ul>
<p>For each prisoner, we need to keep track of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Race</li>
<li>Arrival Date</li>
<li>Amount of Essence Remaining</li>
<li>Location (which cage are they in)</li>
</ul>
<p>Skeksis regularly visit the processing facility to consume essence.</p>
<p>We need to keep track of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Which Skeksis consumed essence</li>
<li>When the essence was consumed</li>
<li>From which prisoner the essence was consumed</li>
<li>How much essence was consumed</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="directions">
<h1>Directions</h1>
<p>Design a database system to store data meeting the above requirements.
Draw a <strong>diagram</strong> that shows the following:</p>
<p>(Note: Do NOT write SQL. Do NOT write python. Boxes and lines are a
perfectly fine way to go.)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>What tables you need and what data needs to be stored in
each table (a.k.a. column names for each table).</li>
<li>The data type of each column.</li>
<li>Any relationships you would build in between the tables.</li>
</ul>
